## 1. What is Angular and how is it different from AngularJS?

**Angular** is a modern, TypeScript-based, front-end web application framework developed and maintained by **Google**. It is a complete rewrite of **AngularJS** (version 1.x), designed to build scalable and performant single-page applications (SPAs).

#### âœ… Key Features of Angular:

- **Component-based architecture**
- **TypeScript support**
- **Powerful CLI for scaffolding and automation**
- **RxJS for reactive programming**
- **Dependency Injection (DI) system**
- **Modular development with NgModules**
- **Built-in routing and lazy loading**
- **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation**
- **Unit and integration testing support**

#### ðŸ†š Angular vs AngularJS: Key Differences

| Feature                  | AngularJS (1.x)              | Angular (2+)                                 |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Language**             | JavaScript                   | TypeScript                                   |
| **Architecture**         | MVC (Model-View-Controller)  | Component-based                              |
| **Mobile Support**       | Limited                      | Designed for mobile apps                     |
| **Performance**          | Slower due to dirty checking | Faster with unidirectional data flow         |
| **Data Binding**         | Two-way by default           | Unidirectional by default + two-way opt-in   |
| **Dependency Injection** | Custom implementation        | Hierarchical DI using TypeScript decorators  |
| **DOM Manipulation**     | Direct DOM manipulation      | Abstracted via `Renderer2`                   |
| **Tooling**              | Manual setup                 | Angular CLI provides powerful tooling        |
| **Modularity**           | Less modular                 | Encourages modular development via NgModules |
| **Testing**              | Less structured              | Built-in testing tools and best practices    |

#### ðŸŽ¯ Summary for Interviews:

- Angular is **not a new version** of AngularJS â€” it's a **complete rewrite**.
- Angular uses **TypeScript**, improving code quality and maintainability.
- Angular improves **performance, scalability**, and supports modern web standards.
- Angular supports **enterprise-level applications**, unlike AngularJS which was suited for smaller apps.
