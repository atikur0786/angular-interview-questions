## 1. What is Angular and how is it different from AngularJS?

**Angular** is a modern, TypeScript-based, front-end web application framework developed and maintained by **Google**. It is a complete rewrite of **AngularJS** (version 1.x), designed to build scalable and performant single-page applications (SPAs).

#### ‚úÖ Key Features of Angular:

- **Component-based architecture**
- **TypeScript support**
- **Powerful CLI for scaffolding and automation**
- **RxJS for reactive programming**
- **Dependency Injection (DI) system**
- **Modular development with NgModules**
- **Built-in routing and lazy loading**
- **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation**
- **Unit and integration testing support**

#### üÜö Angular vs AngularJS: Key Differences

| Feature                  | AngularJS (1.x)              | Angular (2+)                                 |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Language**             | JavaScript                   | TypeScript                                   |
| **Architecture**         | MVC (Model-View-Controller)  | Component-based                              |
| **Mobile Support**       | Limited                      | Designed for mobile apps                     |
| **Performance**          | Slower due to dirty checking | Faster with unidirectional data flow         |
| **Data Binding**         | Two-way by default           | Unidirectional by default + two-way opt-in   |
| **Dependency Injection** | Custom implementation        | Hierarchical DI using TypeScript decorators  |
| **DOM Manipulation**     | Direct DOM manipulation      | Abstracted via `Renderer2`                   |
| **Tooling**              | Manual setup                 | Angular CLI provides powerful tooling        |
| **Modularity**           | Less modular                 | Encourages modular development via NgModules |
| **Testing**              | Less structured              | Built-in testing tools and best practices    |

#### üéØ Summary for Interviews:

- Angular is **not a new version** of AngularJS ‚Äî it's a **complete rewrite**.
- Angular uses **TypeScript**, improving code quality and maintainability.
- Angular improves **performance, scalability**, and supports modern web standards.
- Angular supports **enterprise-level applications**, unlike AngularJS which was suited for smaller apps.

## 2. What are components, and how do you create one?

In Angular, a **component** is the **fundamental building block** of the UI. Every Angular application is made up of components arranged in a tree-like structure, starting from the **root component** (`AppComponent`).

A component controls:

- A **template** (HTML for view rendering)
- A **class** (TypeScript for logic and data)
- **CSS/SCSS styles** (optional styling)

Each component is **encapsulated** and **reusable**, which supports modular and maintainable architecture.

---

#### ‚úÖ Anatomy of a Component

```ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-hello",
  templateUrl: "./hello.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./hello.component.css"],
})
export class HelloComponent {
  message = "Hello, Angular!";
}
```

| Part          | Description                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `selector`    | The custom HTML tag used to embed the component    |
| `templateUrl` | Points to the HTML file for the component          |
| `styleUrls`   | Links to the component's styles                    |
| `class`       | Contains logic, data, methods, and lifecycle hooks |

#### üõ†Ô∏è How to Create a Component

Use Angular CLI for easy scaffolding:

```bash
ng generate component my-component
# or shorthand
ng g c my-component
```

This creates:

```
src/app/my-component/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my-component.component.ts      // Component class
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my-component.component.html    // Template
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my-component.component.css     // Styles
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-component.component.spec.ts // Test file
```

---

#### üìå How to Use a Component

Once created, you can use the component selector (`<app-my-component></app-my-component>`) inside any template, such as `app.component.html`.

---

#### üéØ Summary for Interviews:

- A **component** in Angular is a **self-contained UI unit** made of template, class, and style.
- Components follow a **modular structure** and support **reuse and testing**.
- You create components using `@Component()` decorator.
- Angular CLI makes component generation fast and consistent.
